#Make sure that whenever you change something in models (schema for database), you must make migrations 
#python manage.py makemigrations (generate migration file for changes) 
#python manage.py migrate (apply the migration file changes to the database)
#pillow is used to work with images in python
#Then remember to register to our admin.py 

#Can access profiles through 'from django.contrib.auth.models import User'
#User.objects.filter to get user 
#user.profile.image 
#Location of image: user.profile.image.url
