Routing in urls.py: When a user visits a URL (like /register), Django looks at the urls.py file to find a matching route. 
If a match is found, it directs the request to the associated view function (in this case, register).

Request Object: Django sends a request object to the view function. This object contains metadata about the HTTP request, 
including the request method (e.g., GET or POST) and any data sent by the user (like form data).

Handling POST and GET Requests in the View:

If the request method is POST (meaning the user submitted the form), the code handles it by creating a form instance with the data 
the user submitted (request.POST). This populates the form with the submitted data, which can then be processed (e.g., saved to the database if valid).
If the request is not POST (likely a GET request, when the user first accesses the page), it simply creates an empty form instance, allowing the user to see the form.
Rendering the Form: Finally, the view renders an HTML template (register.html) and passes the form instance to it. The user then sees either an empty form (if it’s a 
GET request) or the form with any data that was previously submitted (if it’s a POST request and the form isn’t valid yet).
